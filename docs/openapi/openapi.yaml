        Authenticate the user with username and password and provides the security means for further API calls.
        When an IdP is configured in the platform and if the user authentication is delegated to that IdP,
        the body response is enriched with the IdP response.
        When the user is authenticated, at least a couple of JWT is returned.
        * An access_token, valid for a short period of time (minutes), can be used to fetch API calls.
        This can be used in the standard http header Authorization as Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
        * A refresh_token, valid for a relatively long period (day(s)), can be used *only* to fetch new access tokens.
        This can be used in the standard http header Authorization as Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
