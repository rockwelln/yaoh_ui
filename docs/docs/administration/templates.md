# Templates

Templates are a way to centralise and to define a text or a document with placeholders usable by workflows and some features of the APIO core.

A common use case is to define a template for an email. The template can be used by a workflow to send an email to a user ([Send email template](../workflows/nodes#send-email)). The template can also be used by the APIO core to send an email to a user when a user is created or when the password is reset.
